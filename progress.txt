- Server returns checkout_url so the browser can redirect to Stripe Checkout.
- Form submits once; no PaymentElement is rendered locally.
- After Checkout completes, Stripe webhooks move the booking through authorization → capturable → captured.
- Accepting a booking retrieves the PaymentIntent and captures it once Stripe marks it capturable.
