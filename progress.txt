Added dedicated first/last name support throughout auth and profile flows, removed dependency on `users_table`, seeded Supabase `user_profiles` during signup/OAuth, blocked unverified logins by resending emails + preventing session establishment, wired avatar uploads and signed URL handling, reworked dashboard/profile UI with controlled sections, and whitelisted Supabase storage host for Next.js images.
